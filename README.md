# Light Year
A hybrid IF engine, lightyears ahead.

We're working on a new class of Interactive Fiction engineâ€“ something modern, sleek, and empowering. Every human being is creative; everyone can tell stories, and technology should enhance their vision, not get in the way. The Light Year engine makes it easy for anyone to create an immersive, enveloping interactive fiction, and provides a comprehensive API for expirenced developers to create something truly unique, and unexpected.

#What is 'IF'?

*Step after step, you decend the cramped spiral-stairway, hearing only your solid leather boots striking the hard granite steps, and seeing little more. If it weren't for the moss occasionally felt along the cold, dull stone walls, it would seem like you're somehow stuck in a loop of the same left turn, and after ten minutes of this, a break might be nice.*

*As if your wish is being granted, the stairway comes to an abrupt end, leaving you with your nose pressed firmly against an old wooden door. Suddenly, you hear a deep voice on the other side, and, startled, you pull your head back. Curiosity again gets a hold of you, though, and you stoop closer to the keyhole, hoping to make out the words.*

*"Yes, but what is IF?"*

*After a few moments of silence, the question is vocalized again; "What is IF?!". This time, it's said with more emotion. Eventually, a sigh can be heard, although higher in pitch. There are two people beyond this door? I was told this crypt had been abandoned.*

*"How simple do I need to make this?", the higher-voice asks. "IF, like interactive fiction."*

*"So, you've said, but this doesn't make any sense. Fiction isn't something to be meddled with, surely, you're playing with the arcane!"*

*"Alright", replies the soprano voice, clearly more agitated than when you first heard it. "Listen well, I shan't explain again."*

<!--
It would seem that fate is not on your side, however, as without warning a loud crack echos through the ancient halls. You fail to stifle a cry, feeling frayed strands tear across your back, leaving a throbbing trail in their wake. Panicked, you stumble forwards, wishing only to escape the reach of your mysterous adversary.

You get it now, right? No? Okay, here's the gist: interactive fiction is a story in which you are an active participant. In traditional cases, short passages of text will precede a text box. After reading, you'd decide on an action, type it, then repeat the cycle. How do you know what to type, you ask? Anything. Type anything. Really. What separates IF from other text-based entertainment is that as the reader, you get to define the story.

Does our hero check that cupboard before continuing onwards? Maybe they find a tin of beans. They examine the tin, and find it contains magical beans, and a warning on the side prompts that they're prone to grow into a giant beanstalk. You- the hero- decide not to take the tin, and instead go south.

Or, maybe, you're playing the role of a space captain, with a whole fleet at your disposal. Are all of those ships- those people's lives- really yours to toss away, though? How do you face the moral dilemma of knowingly sending people to their doom? All I know is, it'd probably be different from how I deal with it. The freedom in IF games can lead to very creative outcomes, some which you might not expect, and others which you may have worked very hard for.

Interactive fiction isn't about controlling a rogue mage in their magical tower, nor is it about making tough moral choices on the bridge of an A3-12 Falcon-class command ship, it's about exploring a new space, realizing yourself there, and seeing what kind of tale the author has in mind for you.
