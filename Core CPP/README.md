//Engine-API
===
---

This is the latest **STABLE** engine API, containing all of the currently implemented C++ files. Copy from this into your project (don't link to it), and please don't push directly. Instead, push to a branch, then open a merge/pull request.

I may compile this into a single framework of some kind later on, but loose files should be fine for now. Plus, that would require built-in language bindings (rather, separate files- a DLL for C#, and Framework for ObjC), so we should do that much later.
